## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### Main Pipeline (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Release creation

**Jobs:**

1. **Test Suite**
   - Runs on Ubuntu
   - Installs Go 1.23
   - Runs tests with coverage
   - Uploads coverage to Codecov
   - Runs linter
   - Builds and tests binary

2. **Build Binaries**
   - Runs on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
   - Builds binaries for all platforms
   - Uploads artifacts

3. **Security Scan**
   - Runs Gosec security scanner
   - Uploads SARIF results

4. **Release** (on release events)
   - Downloads all artifacts
   - Creates GitHub release with binaries

### Release Pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push of version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

**Features:**
- Builds for multiple architectures (amd64, arm64)
- Creates checksums for verification
- Generates installation instructions
- Creates GitHub release with all binaries

### Security Pipeline (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to main
- Pull requests to main
- Weekly schedule

**Features:**
- CodeQL analysis for Go
- Security vulnerability detection
- SARIF results upload

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Services

### Code Quality
- **golangci-lint** - Comprehensive Go linter
- **CodeQL** - GitHub's semantic code analysis
- **Gosec** - Security scanner for Go

### Testing
- **Go Test** - Native Go testing
- **Codecov** - Coverage reporting
- **Make** - Build automation

### Dependency Management
- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates
- **Go Modules** - Dependency management

## üìä Status Badges

The README includes status badges for:
- CI/CD Pipeline status
- CodeQL security analysis
- Go Report Card
- Code coverage
- Go version
- License
- Latest release

## üéØ Key Features

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run tests locally
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run linter
make lint
```

### Multi-platform Builds
- **Linux**: amd64, arm64
- **macOS**: amd64, arm64  
- **Windows**: amd64

### Security Scanning
- Static analysis with CodeQL
- Security vulnerabilities with Gosec
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Release Automation
- Tag-based releases
- Pre-built binaries for all platforms
- Checksums for verification
- Installation instructions

## üîß Configuration

### Linter Configuration
The `.golangci.yml` file is configured for:
- Balanced strictness (not too strict, not too lenient)
- Focus on important issues (errors, security, performance)
- Exclusions for test files and generated code
- Reasonable complexity thresholds

### Dependabot Configuration
- Weekly dependency updates
- Separate configurations for Go modules and GitHub Actions
- Automatic PR creation with proper labels

## üöÄ Usage

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
make deps

# Run tests
make test

# Run linter
make lint

# Format code
make fmt

# Build
make build
```

### Creating Releases
```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# 1. Run tests
# 2. Build binaries for all platforms
# 3. Create GitHub release
# 4. Upload binaries and checksums
```

### Dependency Updates
Dependabot will automatically:
- Check for updates weekly
- Create PRs for available updates
- Use conventional commit messages
- Apply appropriate labels

## üìà Benefits

### For Developers
